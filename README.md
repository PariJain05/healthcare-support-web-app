# Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple healthcare support web application designed
to help NGOs collect patient support requests and respond efficiently
using automated decision logic.

The application simulates an AI-assisted healthcare triage system by
analyzing patient issue types and symptoms to generate appropriate
responses and prioritize urgent cases.


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## 🤖 AI / Automation Concept
The application uses a rule-based intelligent automation system.
Based on the selected issue type (Emergency, Medical Assistance,
Mental Health) and symptom keywords entered by the user, the system
automatically:

- Generates a relevant response
- Flags emergency cases immediately
- Marks certain symptoms (e.g., cold, fever, pain) for priority review

This approach represents a concept-level AI solution similar to
early-stage healthcare chatbots and triage systems.


## 🌍 NGO Use Case
This application can be used by healthcare NGOs to:
- Collect healthcare support requests online
- Provide instant automated acknowledgements
- Prioritize emergency and critical cases
- Reduce manual workload for volunteers
- Improve response time for patients
